# Movie_Recoder
Any movie can be searched by any word in its title. One can add its favourite movies and can view them later whenever he/she wishes.
index.jsp is the frontend where movies can be searched. extract.js is the javascript file which reads the json file of the API. favourite.java and display.java are the servlet files which writes the json.
